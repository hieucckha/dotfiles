-- INFO: plugins
-- we install plugins with neovim's builtin package manager: vim.pack
-- and then enable/configure them by calling their setup functions.
--
-- (see `:h vim.pack` for more details on how it works)
-- you can press `gx` on any of the plugin urls below to open them in your
-- browser and check out their documentation and functionality.
-- alternatively, you can run `:h {plugin-name}` to read their documentation.
--
-- plugins are then loaded and configured with a call to `setup` functions
-- provided by each plugin. this is not a rule of neovim but rather a convention
-- followed by the community.
-- these setup calls take a table as an agument and their expected contents can
-- vary wildly. refer to each plugin's documentation for details.
